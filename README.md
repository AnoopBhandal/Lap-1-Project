An educational multiple choice game, aimed at secondary school, non-STEM students, created using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In the game, users aim to answer questions correctly. If the answer a question wrong, the game ends. If they answer all questions correctly, they win.

## Installation & Usage
### Installation
- Clone the repo.

### Usage
- Open the terminal.
- Navigate to backend/.
- Call `npm run dev` on the command line.
- Open another terminal window.
- Navigate to frontend/ in the Lap-1-Project folder.
- Navigate to index.html.
- Open index.html in the browser.
- Once opened in the browser, you can navigate to quizzes for three different subjects.

## Technologies
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Process
- We began by creating the HTML pages.
- We then created backend/index.js, which runs the server and requires the question data from the relevant json files.
- We then wrote the JavaScript code that is used for the history quiz.
- This was then adapted so that the same file can be used for each subject.

## Wins & Challenges
### Wins
- After answering a question, the quiz tells you if your answer was correct or wrong, and then moves onto the next question if correct.
- The questions are asked in a random order with no repetitions.
- One JavaScript file can be used to run all three quizzes.
### Challenges
- Getting the correct answer button to appear in a random position (rather than always appearing in the same position) was challenging.

## Future Features
- In the future, we would add a second type of quiz. This would be a speed quiz where the user aims to answer as many questions as possible in a given time.
- It would be quite easy to add new subjects.
