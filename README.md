- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Process
- We began by creating the HTML pages.
- We then created backend/index.js, which runs the server and requires the question data from the relevant json files.
- We then wrote the JavaScript code that is used for the history quiz.
- This was then adapted so that the same file can be used for each subject.
